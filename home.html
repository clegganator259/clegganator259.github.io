		Chemical diagrams, in particular molecule depictions are a prevalent means of conveying information in chemistry and biosciences. However, they are commonly given in standard image formats leaving them inaccessible to readers with learning difficulties and print impaired learners.

<P>
	The ChemAccess project aims to provide support for readers with difficulties in accessing, understanding and interacting with chemical diagrams. We concentrate on the provision of fully accessible chemical diagrams for electronic documents, through creation of a fully automated software that will recognise molecule images and transform them into scalable vector graphics that will enable us to provide support for screen readers via auditory descriptions.

<P>
	We work on providing open source software for accessibility to chemical diagrams and we collaborate with a number of related projects.
